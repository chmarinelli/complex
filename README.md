### Note
The user field component does not work 100% correctly, the challenge information was not very clear to me, how it should work. I think that if you had shown me a mock up or explained a little more, I would have succeeded.

What I can understand from the detail of the challenge with the DataSourceAutocompleteField component I could not reached what is required in my opinion.

#### DataSourceAutocompleteField component doesn't work well for multi-selection and infinite scroll to my understanding
